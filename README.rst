AssetGraph-sprite
=================

A plugin (or "transform") for `AssetGraph
<http://github.com/One-com/assetgraph>`_ that optimizes CSS background
images by creating sprite images. The spriting is guided by a set of
custom CSS properties with a ``-ag-sprite`` prefix.

You can tell AssetGraph-sprite that you want to sprite a given CSS
background image by adding a ``-ag-sprite-group`` property to the
selector containing the ``background`` or ``background-image``
property::

    .classone {background-image: url(images/thething.png);      -ag-sprite-group: my-sprite-group; }
    .classtwo {background-image: url(images/theotherthing.png); -ag-sprite-group: my-sprite-group; }

This is valid CSS and will also work fine on its own in "development
mode" without a compilation step, so you don't need to rebuild your
project all the time, except when you want to test the spriting
itself. After being run through the AssetGraph-sprite transform it
will look something like this::

    .classone { background-image: url(7bda8ba87d.png); background-position: 0 0; }
    .classtwo { background-image: url(7bda8ba87d.png); background-position: -34px 0; }

Some additional properties are supported:

``-ag-sprite-padding: <top> <right> <bottom> <left>``
  Adds "keepaway space" around the image in the sprite. Sometimes
  useful if the background image is applied to an element that takes
  up a bigger area than the background image. Supports regular CSS
  padding syntax, including the shorthand variants with 1, 2, or 3
  values. The only supported unit is ``px``. Defaults to ``0 0 0 0``.  Not
  supported by the ``jim-scott`` packer (see the docs for
  ``-ag-sprite-packer`` below).

``-ag-sprite-important: important``
  Makes sure that the injected ``background-image`` property pointing
  at the sprite image gets the ``!important`` suffix.

``-ag-sprite-no-group-selector: true``
  Tells AssetGraph-sprite that you want this selector to contain a
  ``background-image`` property pointing at the sprite image, even
  if the sprite group has a "group selector" configured (see below).


Configuring a sprite
--------------------

If you can guarantee that the HTML elements that need to have the
background image applied are also matched by another selector, you can
save some more bytes by telling AssetGraph-sprite that it only needs
to add the ``background-image`` property pointing at the sprite to that
selector using the ``-ag-sprite-selector-for-group`` property::

    .foo { -ag-sprite-selector-for-group: my-sprite-group; }
    .classone {background-image: url(images/thething.png);      -ag-sprite-group: my-sprite-group; }
    .classtwo {background-image: url(images/theotherthing.png); -ag-sprite-group: my-sprite-group; }

Which compiles to::

    .foo { background-image: url(7bda8ba87d.png); }
    .classone { background-position: 0 0; }
    .classtwo { background-position: -34px 0; }

You can tweak the generated sprite images by putting additional
``-ag-sprite``-prefixed configuration properties into the "group
selector", for example::

    .foo {
        -ag-sprite-selector-for-group: my-sprite-group;
        -ag-sprite-packer: horizontal;
        -ag-sprite-background-color: #a767ac;
    }

These options are currently supported:

``-ag-sprite-packer: horizontal|vertical|jim-scott|try-all``
  Selects the packing algorithm for the sprite. The ``horizontal`` and
  ``vertical`` variants naively lay out the images one after the other.
  This works well when you have a bunch of images with the same height
  or width. The ``jim-scott`` packer is a little fancier, it's an
  implementation of `a floor planning algorithm
  <http://www.blackpawn.com/texts/lightmaps/>`_ originally invented
  by Jim Scott for packing lightmaps. The Jim Scott packer doesn't
  support the ``-ag-sprite-padding`` property on the individual images.
  If you don't specify ``-ag-sprite-packer``, the default is ``try-all``,
  which runs all the algorithms and chooses the packing that produces
  the smallest sprite image (area-wise).

``-ag-sprite-important: important``
  Adds ``!important`` after the injected ``background-image``. As mentioned
  above this is also supported for group selector-less sprites; simply add
  ``-ag-sprite-important: important`` to the selector containing
  the ``background`` or ``background-image`` selector).

``-ag-sprite-image-format: png|jpg``
  The format of the generated sprite. More will be added when
  `node-canvas <http://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas>`_ gains
  support for more image formats.

``-ag-sprite-background-color: red|yellow|#123123|transparent|...``
  Specifies the background color for the generated sprite image,
  supports any color syntax understood by node-canvas, which is the
  entire `CSS3 Color Module <http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-css3-color-20030514/#numerical>`_,
  as far as I can tell. Defaults to ``transparent``.


Installation
------------

For creating the sprite images themselves AssetGraph-sprite uses
`node-canvas <http://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas>`_, which is
not a pure-node module and requires the Cairo development sources
(version 1.10 or later), `libjpeg` (version 8 or later) and
`libgif`. On Ubuntu 10.10 and above you should be able to get them
like this::

    $ sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev libgif-dev libjpeg8-dev

Now you can proceed to install AssetGraph-sprite::

    $ npm install assetgraph-sprite


Usage
-----

Since AssetGraph-sprite is intended to be used as part of an AssetGraph
workflow, first you'll need to have AssetGraph installed to use it properly::

    $ npm install assetgraph

Here's a stripped-down example that loads all CSS files in a
directory, loads all the images linked to by ``background`` and
``background-image`` properties, sprites them according to the
``-ag-sprite-...`` instructions, then writes the resulting CSS and
all the images to a different directory::

    var AssetGraph = require('assetgraph');

    new AssetGraph({root: "path/to/css/files"})
        .loadAssets('*.css')
        .populate({followRelations: {type: 'CssImage'}})
        .queue(require('assetgraph-sprite')())
        .writeAssetsToDisc({url: /^file:/}, "file:///my/output/dir")
        .run(function (err) {
            if (err) throw err;
            // All done!
        });

For a more elaborate example of how AssetGraph-sprite can fit in a
workflow, see the `buildProduction script in AssetGraph-builder
<https://github.com/One-com/assetgraph-builder/blob/master/bin/buildProduction>`_.
